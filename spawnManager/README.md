# Weather Manager Demo

This Unreal Engine project contains a `WeatherManager` actor implemented in C++.
It demonstrates how to drive Niagara systems for clouds, precipitation and lightning.

## Features

- Multiple cloud types (cumulus, cirrus, storm) with adjustable density and speed.
- Precipitation systems for rain, snow, hail and fog.
- Lightning spawning support.
- Wind direction and velocity parameters.
- Simple weighted blending of overlapping weather volumes.

All parameters are exposed to Blueprints so designers can tweak them at runtime or via scripted events.
